# TOFAANGA

This repository contains a react front end that consumes a flask API. 
The repo of the API backend can be found [here](https://github.com/lornatumuhairwe/tofaangaAPI)

The name of this application is based on a Luganda word TOFAANGA' that means DON'T DIE BEFORE ... It is a simple bucketlist application that helps users to track their goals by allowing a logged in user to create bucketlists, add items to the different buckets, view the items in the bucketlists and also be able to delete the bucketlists.
